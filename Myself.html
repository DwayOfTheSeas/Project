			<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>I used to always deeply ponder about this question everyday. Is it my personality, or my character that tells me who I am?
				Or the way that I dress? Or my choice of career? Or, maybe it is a combination of all of these things, because I don’t think
				there is one description or label that is capable of defining me completely.</p>

			<p>However, I can confirm the basics that I am a young male adult, at the age of 19, born and raised in Queens, New York. I love the art of dance and want to become a great web-developer. Both my parents are immigrants from South Korea, making me the 1st generation American in my family. With this fact, as much as I may act like my parents, I am also completely different from them. The things my parents have been exposed to versus the things I have been exposed to during our childhoods are in a sense, polar opposites. My mother is from Chungnam and my father is from Jeonbuk, two provinces in which are mostly farmland and historic sites where urbanization is relatively minimal. As opposed to somewhere like New York City, where nowhere else on planet Earth do you see so many honking cars on the streets or people rushing in and out of the subway stations. You can also see it in the attitude of us New Yorkers by the way we talk and carry ourselves, which emphasizes the peculiarities New Yorkers have become renowned for.
      </p>

			<p>Being a New Yorker myself, I have grown to appreciate the contrasting slow pace of life that other cities and cultures may inhibit. When I visited Korea couple of years ago, I got to see what kind of place/environment my parents grew up and that was when my eyes were open. The world outside some place like New York was so vast just waiting to be discovered. That was when I fell in love with traveling. The power to open one’s eyes just by venturing out beyond his/her bubble was something more than just didactic, but also inspirational.</p>

			<p>Growing up with dance being a big part of my life, something like traveling became a part of my vision. Being able to witness different dance styles and meet new people who share a similar passion for the same cause, was something I strive to experience. Many instances have I thought “damn, this culture could save lives” whether it be for someone who is struggling poverty, drug-addiction, or even for someone feeling a lack of purpose in life. Being able to express yourself physically and emotionally, dance provides a platform where you can to the deepest levels, be yourself. I try to convey my ideas through my movement with the balance of dancing differently from the normal, at the same time not losing sight of my own style and who I am as a person.
      </p>

			<p>So who am I? I am a web-developer, dancer, and a traveler. My experiences with my dance crew, Floor Obsessions, and with many other amazing individuals (Shoutouts to 4theFuture Family), have enabled me to break free from my shell and aspire to dream big.</p>
